# learn-packages-modules-python
My first lesson on creating python package and modules
The following two files have been uploaded in this repo; 
1. A Module contaning functions to calculate various types of fantasy cricket points (for batting, bowling, fielding)
2. A script file to calculate and display the name of the best player aongst a given set of players data on their circket performance
These are just the smallest of the baby steps for creating a fully functional fantasy cricket api
Next Steps will be to make a Dream 11 kind of api by doing the following: -
1. Find a way to scrape cricinfo/cricbuzz to import the player statistics/performance
2. Update the pointsSystem to make it more comprehensive and inclusive of other complex points rules
3. Make the api live for participants to play
